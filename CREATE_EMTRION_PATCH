To Create EMTRION patch just diff the current branch with master or whatever the starting point is.  For example if my branch is testing and I started with master:

git diff master testing > ../uboot.patch

Then replace uboot.patch in twigpilot_linux_image or equivalent

So an example where the git repositories are in the same folder, just cd into the u-boot-at91 directory and then type the following:

git diff reference testing > ../twigpilot_linux_image/EmtrionKernel/uboot.patch
